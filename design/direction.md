# Design Direction

## Approach
Partial brand refresh — keep the existing logo and brand identity, modernize the visual style for the web.

## Principles
- **Photography-forward**: Big hero images of river and canyon landscapes. Let the experience sell itself.
- **Clean and modern**: Generous whitespace, clear typography, uncluttered layouts
- **Mobile-first**: Responsive design starting from mobile, scaling up
- **Fast**: Contrast with the current slow WordPress site — every interaction should feel snappy
- **Trustworthy**: Authority and social proof prominent throughout (60+ years, reviews, certifications)

## Color Palette
Derive from existing brand — earthy tones, river blues. Specific values TBD once brand assets are gathered. See [[open-decisions]].

## Typography
TBD — awaiting brand asset review. See [[open-decisions]].

## Key UI Patterns
- Hero sections with full-bleed photography
- Trip cards with key info at a glance (river, duration, difficulty, price)
- Accordion UI for FAQs
- Multi-step booking flow with clear progress indication
- Sticky header with prominent "Book Now" CTA
- Authority badges (60 years, awards) in strategic locations

## Reference
- The current bikeraft.com has a solid design foundation — the layout and information hierarchy are decent, the execution and performance need modernizing
