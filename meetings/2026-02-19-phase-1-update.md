# Phase 1 Update — 2026-02-19

## Attendees
- Darius Carrick (developer)
- Justin Malloy
- Lauren Wood
- Karen Johnson

## Discussion

### CMS
- Justin has researched and approved using **Sanity CMS** for the new site.

### Booking & Cart Flow
- Justin will check other outfitter cart flows for comparison to help inform our cart/checkout UX design with Arctic.

### Design & Brand
- Brand kit is in motion.
- Justin will schedule a sync meeting with Ezra, Riley, Darius, and others to coordinate design efforts between the brand refresh and the website build.

### Content Strategy
- **Insider Guides / Things to Do** — keep links at the bottom of trip pages, but since this is evergreen content, move it out of the blog and give it a dedicated page (whatever makes the most sense for SEO structure and UX).
- **Spanish content** — confirmed needed on the new site.
- **Legal/policy pages** — confirmed needed (Cancellation & Insurance, Essential Eligibility Criteria, Code of Conduct).

### Hosting & Infrastructure
- Moving forward with **Vercel** for hosting.
- Darius to investigate how email domain management works with Vercel hosting.

### Phase Coordination
- **Phase 2 content** — Justin and Darius will coordinate ad-hoc on content needs.
- **Phase 1 + Phase 3 in parallel** — Darius will finish remaining Phase 1 technical pieces and begin Arctic API integration (Phase 3) in parallel.
