# Progress — 2026-02-12

## Summary

Resolved CI failures across all branches and cleaned up project tooling and documentation. All three branches (`develop`, `beta`, `main`) are now in sync with passing CI.

## What was accomplished

### CI fixes
- Fixed pnpm version specification in `package.json` so GitHub Actions installs the correct version (`dff9bd5`)
- Fixed Prettier formatting in `CLAUDE.md` that was failing `format:check` (`ba93c93`)

### Developer tooling
- Added VS Code workspace configuration (`439c8f1`)
- Added pre-commit hook with husky + lint-staged to enforce formatting on staged files (`5e2145b`)
- Added `.claude` to `.prettierignore` (`c54165b`)

### Project scaffolding cleanup
- Cleaned up Next.js boilerplate and added project-specific placeholders (`6f9f7f6`)
- Fixed E2E test to match updated page title (`a73aff1`)
- Fleshed out README with setup instructions, scripts, and project overview (`ab59f81`)

### Documentation
- Removed "Branch Protection (GitHub)" section from `website/CLAUDE.md` — branch protection is not available on the free GitHub plan, so the section was inaccurate (`8fc2961`)

### Branch sync
- Merged all changes from `develop` → `beta` → `main` and pushed all three branches
- All branches are now at commit `8fc2961` with CI passing

## Decisions made

- **No branch protection**: The repo is on a free GitHub plan, so branch protection rules can't be enforced. Removed the documented rules to avoid confusion. Direct merges and pushes are the workflow for now.
- **Husky + lint-staged for formatting**: Pre-commit hooks run Prettier and ESLint on staged files to catch formatting issues before they reach CI.

## What's next

- Begin implementing actual site features (layout, components, Sanity schema)
- Contact Arctic Reservations for API credentials
- Set up Sanity project and initial schemas
- Design system / Tailwind theme configuration
