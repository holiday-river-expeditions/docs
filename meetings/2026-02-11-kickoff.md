# Kickoff Meeting — 2026-02-11

## Attendees
- Darius Carrick (developer)
- Karen Johnson
- Riley Onyon
- Lauren Wood
- Justin Malloy
- John Wood

## Key Decisions

### Brand Direction
- Not ditching bike trips but orienting the brand around rafting only
- Want to change the domain URL to `holidayriverexpeditions` or similar
- Display authority more — 60 years, TripAdvisor reviews
- Partial brand refresh — keep logo/identity, modernize visual style

### Content & CMS
- Want to ditch the old blog but have a CMS blog feature
- FAQs for any potential questions, with easy workflow to add new ones as discovered
- Stories, history, fun content, photos
- Move off WordPress to a new CMS
- Customization level: non-technical staff edit content, developer controls design/templates
- Currently uses a lot of custom fields in WordPress
- Mobile view adjustments as needed

### Booking & Arctic Reservations
- Arctic Reservations is the booking system: https://www.arcticreservations.com/
- Want more integration with Arctic (currently iframes)
- Have the open seats page generate dynamically
- Existing issue: open seats button does not show just the open seats for that trip
- On the trip page, the "view open seats" button is built into the WordPress header
- General "book now" button could have a better UI — currently slow

### Database
- Fresh version — don't migrate the old one
- Current database can stay as-is for the old site

### Reviews
- Old review system was a WordPress plugin
- Open question: migrate reviews from WP database?
- Leaning toward pushing people to 3rd party reviews (TripAdvisor, Google) instead of on-site
- More integration with Arctic for reviews/evaluations

### Hosting & Analytics
- Current hosting: SiteGround
- Analytics: Google Analytics, PostHog, Facebook/Instagram retargeting
