## UX Observations

### What Works Well — Keep These

- Strong visual identity — canyon photography is stunning, brand is consistent
- Trip detail pages are comprehensive — all the info a customer needs in one place
- Multiple navigation paths — browse by river, destination, trip type, or activity
- Social proof — 611 reviews at 5.0 stars, prominently displayed
- Signature trips on homepage — immediate exposure to hero products with prices

### UX Problems to Fix

#### Navigation / Information Architecture
- **Overlapping nav categories** — "Rivers" vs "Destinations" vs "Trip Type" all lead to similar content. A user looking for Cataract Canyon could find it 3+ different ways.
- **Trip Type dropdown too long** — 11 items. Many niche items (Kayak Workshop, Affinity Trips) could be discovery items within a listing rather than top-level nav.
- **"Resources" label is unclear** — it's actually the blog. "Blog" or "Stories" is clearer.
- **No trip finder / filtering** — no way to filter by date, price, duration, difficulty, or group type.

#### Homepage
- **Hero has no CTA** — beautiful photo but no clear action for the user
- **Category cards lack hierarchy** — all 4 cards are equal weight, no guidance
- **Too much scrolling** — core conversion path is buried under many sections
- **Open Seats is manually updated** — shows "Updated February 12th at 2:00 PM" — should be real-time

#### Trip Detail Pages
- **Arctic widget is an iframe** — jarring visual break from the site design
- **Sidebar pricing is text-heavy** — long price lists could be a cleaner comparison table
- **"Book This Trip" leaves HRE** — user goes to Arctic's system. Our cart+handoff will be smoother.
- **Quick links easy to miss** — small text links between sections

#### Content & Conversion
- **No urgency/scarcity signals** — "Book Now – X Available" only exists in the Arctic widget, not surfaced earlier
- **No trip comparison** — can't compare trips side-by-side
- **Blog disconnected from trips** — posts about specific rivers/trips don't link to booking
- **No "Help me choose" flow** — new visitors have no guided path to the right trip
