|-------------|-----|--------|---------|
| **Production** | `holidayriverexpeditions.com` | `main` (when ready to launch) | Live public site |

## Beta Site

- Hosted on Vercel
- Custom subdomain: `beta.holidayriverexpeditions.com`
- Used for client and team review during development
- Should not be indexed by search engines (`noindex, nofollow` via meta tags or `x-robots-tag` header)
- Optional: password protection via Vercel's built-in feature or basic auth middleware

## Production Cutover

When the site is ready to launch:

1. Point `holidayriverexpeditions.com` DNS to Vercel
2. Remove `noindex` restrictions from production
3. Beta subdomain can remain as a staging environment or be retired
