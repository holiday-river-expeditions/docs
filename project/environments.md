# Environments

## Current Setup (Temporary — Vercel Hobby Plan)

Both repos (`website` and `docs`) are **public** on GitHub and deployed to Darius's personal Vercel account (Hobby/free plan). This is a temporary setup until the site is ready to launch, at which point we'll move to a Vercel Pro team and make the repos private again.

## Website

| Environment     | URL                      | Vercel URL                                        | Branch           | Purpose                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Production**  | *(no custom domain yet)* | `https://website-phi-six-25.vercel.app`           | `main`           | Live public site (when ready to launch)                  |
| **Beta**        | *(no custom domain yet)* | *(deploy from `beta` branch when ready)*          | `beta`           | Stakeholder review and testing before production cutover |
| **PR Previews** | Auto-generated by Vercel | —                                                 | Per pull request  | Review individual changes before merging                 |

## Docs Site

| Environment    | Vercel URL                                | Branch | Purpose              |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------ | -------------------- |
| **Production** | `https://docs-umber-seven.vercel.app`     | `main` | Internal project docs |

## Beta Site

- Hosted on Vercel (Hobby plan, personal account)
- Custom subdomain `beta.holidayriverexpeditions.com` not yet configured — will be added when ready
- Should not be indexed by search engines (`noindex, nofollow` via `x-robots-tag` header in `vercel.json`)
- Optional: password protection via Vercel's built-in feature or basic auth middleware

## Production Cutover

When the site is ready to launch:

1. Create a new Vercel Team (Pro plan)
2. Make both repos private again (one click each in GitHub settings)
3. Create new Vercel Pro projects connected to the private org repos
4. Copy env vars, add domains (`holidayriverexpeditions.com`, `beta.holidayriverexpeditions.com`, docs domain)
5. Update DNS, tear down Hobby projects
6. Remove `noindex` restrictions from production
