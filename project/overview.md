# Project Overview

## Company
**Holiday River Expeditions** is a guided white water rafting and outdoor experience company operating across Colorado and Utah for 60+ years.

- Current website: bikeraft.com (WordPress)
- New domain: holidayriverexpeditions.com (TBD — see [[open-decisions]])

## Why We're Rebuilding
The current WordPress site at bikeraft.com has accumulated years of technical debt:
- Slow performance from plugin bloat and many hands on the codebase over the years
- SEO pollution from legacy content
- Booking via iframe-embedded Arctic Reservations — slow, bad for SEO, poor UX
- Poor mobile experience
- Domain name doesn't reflect the brand direction

## Brand Direction
- **Rafting-first**: Not ditching bike trips but orienting the brand around rafting
- Partial brand refresh: keep logo/identity, modernize visual style
- Display authority more prominently (60+ years, TripAdvisor reviews, certifications)

## Goals
1. Fast, modern, sleek website that reflects the quality of the experience
2. Native booking integration with Arctic Reservations (no iframes)
3. Easy content management for non-technical staff (blog, FAQs, trip details)
4. Strong SEO foundation — clean slate, no legacy content pollution
5. Dynamic open seats page generated from Arctic API
6. Reviews strategy: push to 3rd party platforms (TripAdvisor, Google)
7. Analytics: Google Analytics + PostHog + Meta retargeting
