## Vercel Pro → Hobby Migration

- Deleted old Vercel Pro team and both projects (website + docs site)
- Made both GitHub repos public (`holiday-river-expeditions/website` and `holiday-river-expeditions/docs`)
- Created new Vercel Hobby projects on Darius's personal account:
  - Website: https://website-phi-six-25.vercel.app (deploys from `main`)
  - Docs: https://docs-umber-seven.vercel.app (deploys from `main`, root dir `docs-site`)
- No environment variables set yet — will configure when needed
- Custom domain (`beta.holidayriverexpeditions.com`) not yet configured — will add later

## Branch Cleanup (website repo)

- Merged `develop` into `main` (2 commits: Arctic API env var simplification)
- Deleted `beta` and `develop` branches (local + remote)
- Simplified to single `main` branch + short-lived feature branches via PR

## Docs Updated

- `docs/project/environments.md` — reflects Hobby plan setup, new Vercel URLs, rollback steps
- `website/CLAUDE.md` — simplified branching section for solo dev workflow

## Next

- Configure environment variables on Vercel when ready
- Add custom domain (`beta.holidayriverexpeditions.com`) when ready
- Reintroduce `beta` branch / Vercel Pro team when approaching launch
