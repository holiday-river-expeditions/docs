# Progress — 2026-02-11

Project kickoff day. Scaffolded the website repo and set up the documentation vault.

## Website Repo (15 commits)

### Project Setup
- Initialized repo with CLAUDE.md, .gitignore, and branching strategy (main + develop)
- Created directory layout: `src/components/`, `src/sanity/schemas/`, `src/lib/arctic/`, `src/app/api/`
- Added VS Code workspace configuration
- Wrote README with setup instructions and available scripts

### Tooling & DX
- Configured Prettier + ESLint with TypeScript strict mode
- Set up Vitest + React Testing Library for unit/integration tests
- Set up Playwright for E2E tests
- Added Husky + lint-staged pre-commit hook to enforce formatting

### CI/CD
