## Arctic API — Documentation Update & Integration Planning

### What happened
Arctic Reservations replied to our API access inquiry. Their email unblocked credential creation and clarified access scopes and support model.

### What was done
- **Updated `docs/project/arctic-api.md`**: Added Support Policy, Credential Setup, Access Scopes, and Integration Strategy sections. Updated Action Items (credential blocker resolved) and Notes.
- **Updated `docs/project/open-decisions.md`**: Marked Arctic API Credentials as resolved.
- **Updated `docs/reference/arctic-api-endpoints.md`**: Added access scope columns to all endpoint tables (read-only vs read/write per access level).
- **Updated `docs/project/build-phases.md`**: Annotated Phase 3 with resolved credential blocker and added refined task sequence (create clients, store creds, build typed client, read-only first).
- **Updated `website/.env.example`**: Replaced single `ARCTIC_API_KEY` with single-client OAuth 2.0 credential vars (`ARCTIC_*`).
- **Drafted response** to Arctic outlining our intended API scope.

### Decisions made
- **Single API client**: `hre-website` at "Read-only with Financial Data" access level — provides read/write on persons and reservations (sufficient for booking), while restricting write access to operational endpoints we don't need to modify. No admin access required.
- **Resilience strategy**: Zod validation, retry with backoff, fallback UI, ISR caching — since custom integrations are unsupported by Arctic

### What's next
- Send response to Arctic (pending review)
- Create API clients in Arctic admin once response is sent
- Payment processing question still open (#decision-needed)
