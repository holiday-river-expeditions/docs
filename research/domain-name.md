# Domain Name Research

## Recommendation: holidayriverexpeditions.com

Based on research conducted 2026-02-11, `holidayriverexpeditions.com` is the best available option.

## Findings

### holidayriverexpeditions.com
- **Already owned by Holiday** — currently redirects (301) to bikeraft.com
- Exact brand-name match for SEO and recognition
- Matches third-party listings on TripAdvisor, Yelp, Google, and adventure.travel
- Zero acquisition cost or risk

### holidayriver.com
- Connection refused — likely registered by a third party but inactive
- Would require acquisition (cost and outcome uncertain)
- Shorter, but sacrifices brand clarity

### Other Alternatives Considered

None of these are currently owned and would require acquisition, reinforcing why `holidayriverexpeditions.com` remains the recommendation.

**Short & clean**
- `holidayexpeditions.com` — drops "river" so less brand-specific; could work but loses geographic identity
- `holidayrivers.com` — plural feels off for a single-company brand; potential confusion with the singular

**Descriptive / action-oriented**
- `holidayrivertrips.com` — clear intent, decent SEO for "river trips"; slightly generic
- `holidayrafting.com` — strong for rafting SEO but excludes non-rafting trips (hiking, horseback)
- `floatholiday.com` — creative, but not immediately recognizable as Holiday River Expeditions
- `raftholiday.com` — same issue as above; sounds like a generic activity rather than a brand

**Modern / brandable**
- `holidayriver.co` — short and clean; `.co` is less trusted by some audiences and easy to mistype as `.com`
- `holidayriver.travel` — industry-relevant TLD; less familiar to general consumers
- `holidayriver.adventures` — descriptive TLD; long overall and uncommon extension

**With prefix/suffix**
- `goholidayriver.com` — action-oriented; "go" prefix is a proven pattern (e.g., godaddy); adds length
- `holidayriverco.com` — clean, modern feel; risk of confusion with `holidayriver.co`

## Why holidayriverexpeditions.com Wins

1. **Already owned** — no acquisition cost or risk
2. **Exact brand match** — customers searching "Holiday River Expeditions" find it immediately
3. **SEO advantage** — exact-match domain for branded searches
4. **Professional and trustworthy** — fits a company with 60+ years of history
5. **Length is acceptable** — most visitors arrive via search, social, or review sites rather than typing URLs directly

## Additional Notes

- `bikeraft.com` can continue as a short redirect for print/merch if needed
- Moving the primary domain off `bikeraft.com` aligns with the brand pivot away from biking toward rafting-first positioning
- All existing third-party profiles (TripAdvisor, Yelp, Google Business) already reference "Holiday River Expeditions" by name, reinforcing the SEO value
